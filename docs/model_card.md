# Model Card for Electric Ride-Hailing Demand Prediction Model

## Model Overview
The Electric Ride-Hailing Demand Prediction Model is designed to forecast the number of ride requests (demand) in a slot-based scheduling model. It uses a Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost) to predict demand based on historical patterns, helping optimize vehicle allocation and reduce downtime.

## Intended Use
The model is intended for use by ride-hailing service providers to predict demand in different time slots and locations, allowing for more efficient vehicle scheduling and improving service reliability.

## Training Data
The model was trained on a synthetic dataset with 10,000 entries, including features such as `timestamp`, `location`, `time_slot`, `hovered_slots`, `last_served_location`, `cancelled_rides`, `frequency_of_rides`, and `demand`. These features provide insights into user behavior patterns and demand trends across time slots and locations.

## Performance Metrics
The model was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the model's prediction accuracy.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Quantifies the average of the squared errors between predicted and actual demand.

## Limitations
- The model may underperform if there are sudden shifts in demand due to factors not represented in historical data, such as large-scale events or unexpected weather changes.
- As a synthetic dataset, it may not capture all complexities of real-world data, so real-world performance may vary.

## Ethical Considerations
While this model helps improve service efficiency, there are ethical concerns to consider:
- **Bias in Location Data**: Predictions may be skewed if certain locations experience more demand, potentially leading to over-servicing some areas while underserving others.
- **Privacy**: Although this is a synthetic dataset, real-world applications should consider user privacy and data security.
